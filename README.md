# What Is A Film Engine?
A film engine is a category of real-time computer software designed specifically for filmmaking,
animation, and visual effects. Unlike game engines, which were originally created to
power interactive gameplay, a film engine is optimized for cinematic storytelling,
high-quality rendering, and production workflows unique to film.

Film engines allow directors, animators, and visual effects professionals to create,
edit, and render complex sequences in real time. This approach reduces the need for lengthy
offline rendering and makes it possible to preview, adjust, and finalize shots interactively during production.

# What Is Univah?
**Univah** is the fastest real-time 3D animation, VFX and rendering software built for speed creators and Film Directors. Univah is tailor made for professional filmmakers who need powerful real-time production quality features and graphics without an overly complex User Interface, long learning curve or overwhelming node-based workflows. Univah Pro is the final step in the animation pipeline. 
Create anywhere, render in Univah.

  ## About
  Univah Pro is currently in active development by The Stephanie Michaels Software Company, located in Houston Texas. 
  The Development of Univah started in 2022 and its early versions were not very good. The Development team worked hard and started over 4 times.
  Making elite softwares on the same level as Houdini and Maya is not an easy task. However, since making a real-time version of Maya and Houdini was the goal, after yeas of research and several major rewrites,
  Univah Pro has achieved and to a degree, even surpassed softwares like Autodesk Maya, Blender and Houdini in speed, Real-Time Render Quality, Ease of Use, Workflow and cleanliness.
